# a pipeline for quick data analysis and machine learning

## file_operate:

***
--------
> <u>__*~~123~~*__</u>

* read file and do base operate like auto asdtype etc.
* it support multi type files operates together.

## preprocess:

    create a preprocessor to preprocessing(dropna,fillna,dropoutlyers...)
    you can select the file and cols by passing dict-type args.
## analysis:
    base on the previous manipulations,we get clean datas,we can now acutally start the analysis tasks:
    correlation:
        get correlations between value-type features and labels. 
        compare the correlation between class-type features and labels.
## ploting:    
    draw graceful basic figures(linear,scatter,bar) fast and scalably.

## modeling:
    we provide base ml models to complete classification or regression tasks
